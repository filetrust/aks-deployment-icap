### Azure Subscription Pre Requisite

- There should be atleast one subscription associated to azure account
- The subscription should have **Contributor** role which allows user to create and manage virtual machines
- A service principle with Contributer rights within the subscription of choice
  - You will need the ```ClientID``` and ```ClientSecret```
- This documentation will provision a managed Azure Kubernetes (AKS) cluster on which to deploy the application. 
- This cluster has configured to auto scaling and  runs on a minimum of 4 nodes and maximum of 100 nodes.
- The specification of the nodes is defined in the `modules/aks01` configuration of this deployment
- The default configuration is to run 4 nodes of which will consume one virtual CPUâ€™s (vCPU) of  type **Standard_DS4_v2** type anf **100 gb** on disk size  -
- The total amount of vCPU available in an Azure region is determined by the subscription itself.
- When deploying, it is essential to ensure that there is enough vCPU available within your subscription to provision the node type and count specified.

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Clone Repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/k8-proxy/icap-aks-delivery.git
cd icap-aks-delivery
git submodule init
git submodule update

```
   
### 2.2 Firstly make sure you are logged in and using the correct subscription.

```bash

az login
az account list --output table
az account set -s <subscription ID>

# Confirm you are on correct subscription
az account show

```

### 2.3 Add Terraform Backend Key to Environment

- Check if you have access to keyvault using below command where $VAULT_NAME is output value from step 2.4
```
az keyvault secret show --name terraform-backend-key --vault-name $VAULT_NAME --query value -o tsv
```
- Export the environment variable "ARM_ACCESS_KEY" to be able to initialise terraform

```
export ARM_ACCESS_KEY=$(az keyvault secret show --name terraform-backend-key --vault-name $VAULT_NAME --query value -o tsv)
```
 
- Check if you can access ARM_ACCESS_KEY as variable
```
echo $ARM_ACCESS_KEY
```
- In case setup healthcheck returns any errors, fix them before proceeding

### 2.4 File Modifications

- backend.tfvars - this will be used as azure backend to store deployment state.

- terraform.tfvars

```
vim terraform.tfvars

# give a valid region name
azure_region="UKWEST"

# give a short suffix, maximum of 3 character.
suffix="stg"

```

## 4. Pre deployment

### 4.1 ICAP Port customization
- By default icap-server will run on port 1344 for SSL and 1345 for TLS
- If you want to customize the above port, please follow below procedure
```
vim terraform.tfvars
```
- Edit variables `icap_port` and `icap_tlsport` according to requirement and Save it.

Note : Please avoide port 80, 443 since this will be used for file-drop UI.

## 5. Deployment
### 5.1 Setup and Initialise Terraform

- Run following:
```
terraform init -backend-config="backend.tfvars" 

```
- Run terraform validate/refresh to check for changes within the state, and also to make sure there aren't any issues.
```
terraform validate

#Output should be: Success! The configuration is valid.
```

- Run
```
terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars
```

- Now you're ready to run apply
``` 
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars

# You will get below output. Make sure to enter YES when prompt
